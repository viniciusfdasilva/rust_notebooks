    "## Programming a Guessing Game\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here’s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.\n",

    "### Setting Up a New Project\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up a new *project*, go to the projects directory that you created in Chapter 1 and make a new project using Cargo, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ cargo new guessing_game\n",
    "$ cd guessing_game\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first command, *cargo new*, takes the name of the project (*guessing_game*) as the first argument. The second command changes to the new project’s directory.\n",

    "### Processing a Guess\n",

    "The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process that input, and check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we’ll allow the player to input a guess. Enter the code in Listing 2-1 into *src/main.rs*\n",
