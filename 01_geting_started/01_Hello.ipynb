    "  ### Anatomy of a Rust Program\n",
    "  Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of the puzzle:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```rust\n",
    "  fn main() {\n",
    "\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These lines define a function named main. The `main` function is special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. Here, the first line declares a function named `main` that has no parameters and returns nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the main function holds the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This line does all the work in this little program: it prints text to the screen. There are four important details to notice here.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, `println!` calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it would be entered as `println` (without the `!`). We’ll discuss Rust macros in more detail in Chapter 19. For now, you just need to know that using a `!` means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function and that macros don’t always follow the same rules as functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, you see the `\"Hello, world!\"` string. We pass this string as an argument to `println!`, and the string is printed to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, we end the line with a semicolon (`;`), which indicates that this expression is over and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Rust code end with a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve just run a newly created program, so let’s examine each step in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by entering the `rustc` command and passing it the name of your source file, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "$ rustc main.rs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just compiling with `rustc` is fine for simple programs, but as your project grows, you’ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your code. Next, we’ll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write real-world Rust programs.\n",
